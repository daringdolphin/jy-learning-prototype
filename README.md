This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed on your system. If you need to install pnpm, you can do so with:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Installation

1. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Development

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start the development server
- `pnpm build` - Build the application for production
- `pnpm start` - Start the production server
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint for code linting
